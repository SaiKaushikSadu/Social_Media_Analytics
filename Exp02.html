      <td>it's been a part of our culture for years I don't think braids is going anywhere we've been getting them since we were young like we getting braids at 2 three now many people do use braids you can see them when you go on vacation but the fact of the matter is that the most common um consumer would be black women so what we're saying that in this small study we found 90% of the products for instance having lead one of the products had no heavy metals for instance so that one tells us well you can make this stuff safer and we suspect that if we had tested wider we would have found more samples my first was it's about time that people were thinking about exposures that are really isolated to certain racial and ethnic groups for a consumer report this digestible and a start this is great but moving forward we're going to have to have rigorous methods I should probably start bringing awareness to clients cuz that's serious you know the more that we can raise awareness that some of these cultural routines could potentially provide harm is us having the potential to stop that harm</td>

      <td>is Jakarta safe for women if you're planning a trip to Jakarta and wondering how safe it is for women your right to ask let's break down the facts to help you make an informed decision first it's important to understand that safety concerns can vary depending on the area and the situation in Jakarta women's safety is a significant issue particularly in public spaces a safety audit conducted in three areas of Jakarta south Jakarta East Jakarta and West Jakarta highlighted key concerns such as sexual violence and harassment against women public transportation is one of the areas where women face significant risks there have been reported cases of sexual assault and even murder of female users of public transport for instance a university student was robbed murdered and raped while using a public minivan in 2011 these incidents have led to a movement demanding safer public transport for women despite these challenges many women in Jakarta feel relatively safe especially when taking necessary precautions for example using reputable taxi services like Bluebird or ride sharing services such as Go Jack or grab can help minimize risks it's also advised to avoid walking alone at night and to keep valuables secure the local culture and Community play a significant role in safety as well Jakarta is a conservative city with a predominantly Muslim population and dressing modestly can help avoid unwanted attention however even with these precautions some women may still experience harassment or uncomfortable situations in terms of general safety Jakarta is considered safer than many other major cities in terms of violent and petty crime however corruption and bribery are factors that affect the overall crime rate natural disasters and terrorist activities are also concerns that Travelers should be aware of to stay safe in Jakarta it's recommended to follow basic safety practices such as using crossbody bags keeping an ey on your belongings and avoiding scams using ATMs in busy public places and protecting your card ination are also important in summary while Jakarta does present some safety challenges for women par particularly in public spaces and transportation taking the right precautions and being aware of the local environment can help ensure a safer experience by understanding these factors and taking necessary steps women can navigate Jakarta more confidently</td>

      <td>[Music] a wife's primary duty is to serve her husband i believe that as just a person as a woman in general my first priority is to God and being obedient to him but being a wife I believe being a submissive wife and loving your husband as we have been asked to by God um I believe that that's the foundational purpose of being a wife and then in turn leading your children when I first got married I got married at 18 feel like in my role as a wife I have learned that in order for me to be a good mother in order for me to be good in our marriage i am putting him first and I am serving him and that's my priority it's crazy how this type of woman is not the norm anymore uh back in time not so not so far long ago too this was the normal type of woman but now we have the modern woman yeah I mean I definitely agree um I got married at 21 years old um I was never really like the you know independent woman i grew up with a single mother and when I first met my husband we were 14 years old and it instantly I was like this is the man that I want to marry and it really made me dive into being a godly wife so you kind of you touched on that a little bit and I 100% agree that when you're serving your husband um you have to also serve God and if you do not have that kind of relationship with your husband that you do with God then it's going to kind of lead down the path of like I'm me and I care about myself and he's going to care about himself instead of making those he's actually right you know a relationship that's uh intertwined with uh religion and God it's uh there's a better stronger foundation there you know there's a level of accountability that you have because you're accountable to God the higher purpose a higher power so it would definitely be harder for you guys to break up it'd be like breaking up with God itself right sacrifices for each other so I definitely you know for myself I try to put him above all obviously I do take care of myself it's not like I'm just like oh yeah like she can just go down the drain it's a give and take so I fully am there for my husband and whatever he needs me to do is something that I look forward to doing for him because whatever you give you will receive so I try to be the best wife that I can be to him so that he can be the best husband that he can be to me y have the disagree step forward do you see the difference between the agree and disagree you could It's It's the look it's a certain feel that they give off so does it go both ways is it is it just I should serve my husband not my husband should serve me as well you see she's automatically looking to get something it's that's what happens when you don't believe in God it's just automatically me me um so in our view and as I believe Christians should have that view is your husband is supposed to love you as Christ loved the church and that actually is a bigger task than wives submit to your husband so in turn I'm submitting to him but he is actually supposed to be obedient to God which means he's supposed to love me as much and if he loves me as much as Christ loves the church then it's going to be a mutual relationship exactly you know so since the husband loves God and he worships God and he uh is going to listen to his teachings he wouldn't mistreat his wife because one of God's orders is treat your wife good you know so that's another reason why women should look for men that have faith because they will not dishonor God so they won't dishonor you essentially if we're going to have mutual conversations mutual decisions be made it's not that he's ruling over me he's telling me what to do and taking charge of everything it's that he loves me enough to care for me as he should i think as any husband should for his wife yeah 100% i think that um a big misconception with submitting to your husband is that it's I submit to him and he has the final say and he does whatever he wants and I don't have a say it's more of like okay I I'm going to come to you with my opinions and these are the ideas that I have and at the end of the day he will decide on the ideas you know but I do have that say i can go to him and I say "Okay well I think that we should move to Thailand." And he's going to decide if that's a good idea for us or not it's not like he comes in the house and he's like "Yeah we're moving let's go." Yeah a good man will listen a good man will you know counsel with his wife and take her suggestions you know but ultimately it should come down to the man's say right that's all it is but we do take your suggestions go back why does he get to decide that's what I was wondering because leadership is a service because he's a better leader and he's more logical so the service he provides is his leadership and if you've ever been in a leadership position then you'll know that it's actually an immense weight to carry to lead people and and just carry that final responsibility and as a servant leader you know you have their best in mind when you when you are leading people so that's that's the service that he provides and it's actually Yeah well it I guess that's a great question it depends on how you would define submission being a triedwife so as a Christian I would say there's definitely a line my first priority is to God and u my husband can't cause me to do anything that would jeopardize that and he can't treat me in a way that's dishonorable or not generous so I think I in my partnership with my husband it really does feel like a partnership and so I disagree in the sense that for us major life decisions even dayto-day decisions there is negotiation between the two of us often times I will win most negotiations why would you be happy that you're bullying your husband it's kind of you're just pretty much showing that he's a weak man sometimes as well but there is a foundation of trust communication leadership but I think for us our marriage functions more like a partnership where um yeah I guess mutual uh I'm pretty sure he's in this relationship where he's walking on eggshells he's essentially just telling her "Yeah yeah sure." But in his heart he wants to put his foot down but he can't because she might use um sex for compliance or you know he might have to sleep on the couch or the silent treatment so he just doesn't want to go through something like that so he'll just agree you know uh trust and negotiation comes into a play a lot more than uh you know we're doing this and that's how we're doing it so and do you guys believe that the man or the husband should be a leader just because he is the male or is it because he displays certain leadership qualities could it be the other way around if the woman well some certain men are not smart or leaders you know but it's up to the woman to identify if this man is worthy enough for her to be led by him you know you just got to choose a good leader you got to scan him from head to toe and just analyze is could this guy lead me to the promised land was somebody who would fit better into the role of a leader um no it's it's built in it's like baked in in biology so hormonally you know men's No I don't agree with that how so um I mean sure you can say that there are bi See she said that she didn't agree but now she's pretty much saying she agrees with the biology part you see that's why men have to be leaders because her first response was emotion you can't lead by emotion like that logical difference between a man and a woman but that doesn't make why I get so upset because why are men inherent triggeredly born deserving respect but we have to earn all of our respect we're not born with respect we have to earn it you know everybody has to earn their respect she thinks that it should just be given but no you have to earn all respect in this life right there was there's no biology that says because of feminism we have to earn it because of feminism where we made ourselves compete with men rather than relaxing into our feminine maturity exactly you wanted to be equal this is it we don't have to earn yeah what do you think feminism is i'm just curious of course it is it's the leveling of the playing ground for the two genders yes well um I would go by the definitions of the firstwave feminist who sought to overthrow the family and that's what they sought to do i don't think that's true so who who would you say were like the first wave well feminism the the typical definition is social political and economic equality between the sexes i don't think anything in that definition is saying we should overthrow the family or that we don't believe in loving uh marriages or partnerships but when you say these biological differences between men and women make men better suited to be a leader which ones and where is where's like your basis for that what what skills men are larger they're stronger hormonally men produce more vasopressin which is the hormone that makes them better um protectors and providers they're able to just respond better to threats whereas women produce more oxytocin we're smaller we're more vulnerable we're the fairer sex the oxytocin is a trust and you know bonding hormone that we're supposed to use to take care of those weaker than us like children like the sick the poor the elderly when we channel that you know that the way that God made us then those people are actually under our authority as women we have the responsibility to care for them just like men have the responsibility to use their strength to care for us i just I think what's standing out to me is that these biological differences that you're noting is actually something that feminism is seeking to actually support because true feminism at its core is about the safety and equity for women in society so that women cannot just it's not about dismantling the family what's what does she mean by the safety like this is 2025 women are the safest ever in history especially uh in uh North America i don't know about you know other other third world settings but North America set up maximum safety for women we got police we got the fire departments we got the air conditioning we have everything to keep them comfortable and safe what is she talking about it's about creating agency for women to choose their lives not at their not not based on you know whatever your personal beliefs are or the beliefs that are outlined by society but whatever path that they have chosen for themselves that's at the true core of feminism it's not about women being better or stronger or the same as men it's about women being safe in this world no it's about being equal to men in a world where the patriarchy threatens women's safety and agency sorry sorry whoa how does the patriarchy threaten your safety we keep you safe without men without good men bad men would take you guys over you know they would have have their way with you we are the safety can I ask how how are how are you threatened how am I threatened so I'll I'll tie it back to the biological differences that you noted there i got to hear this there there's a reality that women face both biologically which we all can you know we all all of us here can understand and empathize with but also just like within society there is a there's a pretty unequal steep right and so for the role that men occupy just in general in society and the freedom that men are able to maneuver through society with that to me is why feminism is so necessary to open paths for women who might otherwise not be able to she didn't explain how we're how the men are a threat she just gave a word salad and said nothing at all about anything recently in Iran recently in Iran I'll give you an example recently in Iran there was a woman who was protesting because there was a strict dress code policy she had to go all the way to Iran to make a point booked the ticket and everything you like we're talking about women in North America first world how are you unsafe and on top of that how does the patriarchy meaning men make you guys more unsafe please explain i would like to know and she walked through the streets in her protest within her underwear it was a very brave courageous act that is of true feminism and what happened she was disappeared so if you look at the way that society treats women's bodies versus men's bodies that inherent difference it creates violence that threatens us at our core and so by feeling as though we need to submit ourselves to men to me that that sounds like a like a defense mechanism and imagine tying your safety to that one story so she's basically saying she's afraid of her safety in North America because of a story of something in that happened in Iran in their culture like isn't that mental illness that's got to be mental illness what stands out when I'm listening to you all speak and I and and if you find empowerment through submitting to your husband that's fine but for me personally my brand of feminism is that I think that if a woman finds empowerment through that more power to her but I think that the women who don't find that empowering should also have the ability or the agency to do as they please that's just how I view it yeah can I circle back something you said earlier so a lot of this oh they're bigger than us and is true men on average are far bigger than women but I don't see how that goes into like how emotional someone is or how these leadership skills that they have no but it's if that was the case then why This girl knows the the science and biology but she's playing dumb like you know like she knows that women get periods and they're more emotional this that and that she knows the whole but she's acting like it doesn't exist i don't get it why did God create so many women that are excellent attorneys excellent doctors it's almost 50% of the field now that these women are killing business owners why did they give Why did God give so many women because there's so much overlap when it doesn't come to physical strength between men and women on things like how agreeable they are if they're able to have those leadership qualities so many women were blessed with those absolutely women are are brilliant yeah so women are excellent adviserss and mothers and teachers and influencers right we know about that women are great influencers they're the most powerful influencers so I'm not in any way saying that women aren't capable i'm just saying should we go out and compete with men or should we actually take our power and harness it and use it in other ways and in fact some of the anti-suffragettes held this belief they were concerned that if women achieved suffrage that their influence would be diluted because they would be forced to go out and compete like headtohead and they would kind of just lose that status as being admired as wise counsel in society so so like these females that are like pediatric surgeons like some of the top in the field you don't think they're doing as much of a service as if they were just to stay home and nurture well I think they're putting themselves at a disadvantage too because look at the wage gap there does exist a wage gap even if you have a really skilled like female surgeon and a male surgeon and it's because biologically like they can't push and push and push themselves at the same in the same way that a man can so like no this is true i I disagree completely i've seen women not only not only do women usually um meet expectations they exceed them in in a lot of situations and I don't think that you can say like there are so many women who have just could you please give an example and stop being so vague like I they don't ever give examples of anything they just say the women are so great at this and but but what exactly is the this and that could you explain further please been so much far greater than their male counterparts in and almost like what like what exactly what profession what industry because from what I know men dominate all fields that they're in so I I I don't know exactly what she's talking about in what in a lot of situations in in like in school in science in in in all of these places where women are coming to the forefront and say and like doing their jobs and doing them well they've not only exceeded but they've had to work twice as And why do they have to work twice as hard because of the patriarchy huh what a cop out everything because of the patriarchy what what do you mean by patriarchy are you talking about a certain group of men or you talking about all men twice as hard for them because we are we are bodies like we are built that we are constantly working i'm working right now cuz my body's getting ready to ovulate right whereas men don't work in that same way like my body is always working harder than a man's body i will say that we are working harder because our bodies are built to do something that a man could never do do you believe that then the wife should lead the family no I think that I agree you see all this complaining but you don't even want to lead you see what I'm saying they want to be known for being good leaders but they don't want to lead so do you not understand why men are suited to be leaders because we naturally want to be leaders the math is not mathing with these people agree with her that it's a partnership like that a man should never be thought of as the final decision as that how he is suddenly able to to lead and know know but they can't even see how they're illogical you know even just that one statement they don't want the man to be just the automatic leader but they don't want to lead so it's like what are you complaining about it's very childish at this It's very childish everything and know all and then she is just here to I don't know serve and sit by it's like they don't want to help they don't want to serve you they want they don't they don't like that word that word serve it's like they think it's slavery automatic slavery but if you're mature and you understand what that word means it's not a bad thing they need to just be reprogrammed from that different lens is needed people should be looked at as individuals and not based on their gender so there could be areas of expertise that my partner is is better equipped for and there are areas of expertise I am better equipped for and to your earlier point like it it's like women didn't have advantages for so long and now we're seeing this shift where like boys need our help because as soon as you let women into education we started surpassing them and our wages have gone up okay so women do uh enroll into college and university more but they tend to go with the teaching nursing psychology majors compared to men that follow the whole science technology and math path right so her point about going to college more doesn't make you guys better leaders sorry up and up and up let women into education could you clarify that no no saying as soon as we started pushing for like women to get into STEM and we started doing this push to get women educated we not only met the the same standard that men were operating at we exceeded it and now women are outperforming men in almost all like exams I don't think women I don't think people that's cap man people should do anything I think people can do anything I don't think there should be any societal expectation on any person man or you see that's the problem I have with their form of leadership there's no structure She just said nobody should have any roles or any expectations in society you can just do what you want but that's not how the world works there's expectations and there's roles for everybody you know everybody's got to play a part without any structure without leadership without defined roles I just think there's total chaos and total mayhem and that's why men should lead because women don't want to on to the next manifest my own destiny sex drugs and rock and roll the perfect recipe may they remember me my words are live on i'm guided by an energy of flame hold it close to you check out my melody this is the media that's been leading you i'll show you a thing misdirection what's the message they don't want you to win</td>
